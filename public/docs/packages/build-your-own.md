# Building your own package

In MakeCode you can create new custom blocks to use in the editor and include them in your projects. You do this by building a package. Packages are really useful for publishing drivers for accessories and hardware, as well as adding in new software features.

Only packages on the 'approved package list' are available to users directly to add into the MakeCode editor at https://makecode.microbit.org.

## Publishing packages

You publish a package on GitHub and request **[approval](./approval)** for it if necessary.

## How do I start building a package?

Go to the MakeCode package documentation and see the [getting started](https://makecode.com/packages/getting-started) page.
